Research Interests

I study the centers of galaxies in the nearby universe by measuring their masses to better understand the evolution of galaxies with their central objects. The galactic centers contain both black holes and nuclear star clusters. I use the stellar kinematics near the centers to determine the amount of mass contained in the black holes and nuclear star clusters.

*How massive are the black holes in lowest-mass galaxies?*

*How do nuclear star clusters evolve with their host galaxies?*

*How did the nuclear star clusters form?*
