1. Detection of Enhanced Central Mass-to-Light Ratios in Early-Type Galaxies: Evidence for Black holes?

A brief summary:

This work focuses on a sample of nearby low-mass ETGs with the purpose of finding their BH masses using ground-based low-resolution integral-field spectroscopic data. With a ∼ 1′′ resolution, we cannot usually resolve the sphere of influence for these BHs. Therefore, we implemented a new method for detecting their presence by comparing their mass-to-light ratios in the center and outer parts of the galaxies.

For this, we selected a subset of 27 galaxies from the ATLAS3D survey that also had existing high- resolution ∼ 0.05′′ Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. We created mass models for all the galaxies using Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) models. We excluded the galaxies that had large color variations in the central ∼1′′, to exclude those with stellar population variations. Using the MGE models we combined them with the central velocity dispersions from the ATLAS3D data using Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to obtain a central mass-to-light (M/L) ratio. To quantify this central M/Ls, we compared them to the M/Ls that were derived by dynamically fitting the outer regions (>2′′) of the galaxies. This can be seen in Figure 1. We accounted for systematic biases, instrumental uncertainties, PSF errors, anisotropic effects etc, but we still could see a median enhancement of ∼14% in the central M/L. Assuming this enhancement is due to BHs we also derived BH masses using Jeans’ models. Recent work done in Krajnovíc et al. (2018) have confirmed BH masses in 2 galaxies from our sample using high-resolution data within 1σ of our BH masses. The primary results are:

- A central M/L enhancement detected in ∼80% of the galaxies in this sample of low-mass ETGs.

- Assuming this enhancement is due to BHs, we find BH masses for these galaxies. We find two galaxies
with >3σ enhancement in M/L which give a high BH mass of ∼10<sup>8</sup>M$_\odot$.

- We also predict the possibility of low-mass ETGs acting as progenitors for Ultra-Compact Dwarf (UCD) galaxies.

*Fig:1* : The ratio of central M/L<sub>cen</sub> and M/L<sub>dyn</sub> in r-band (derived from dynamical models fit outside the nucleus and within ∼1R$_e$) are plotted against the mass of the galaxy. The galaxies that had a color gradient in central 1′′ are indicated in gray as their M/Lcen values are likely less reliable. The error bars include both errors from velocity dispersion measurements and mass modeling errors. Right Panel: Distribution of enhancement of central (M/L)<sub>cen</sub> with respect to (M/L)<sub>dyn</sub>. This indicates the percentage by which (M/L)<sub>cen</sub> is higher than (M/L)<sub>dyn</sub>; the median enhancement is 14%.
